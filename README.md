# Keyword-Search

## Description
The Keyword-search / Scrabble Solver is a Java program designed to help users find valid English words 
from a given set of letters, typically for Scrabble or other word games. 
It uses a dictionary text file containing valid English words to compare against the user's input, 
returning all possible word matches based on the available letters.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several core Java libraries and techniques to implement a word-finding solution efficiently:

### 1. **`java.io.BufferedReader` and `java.io.FileReader`**
   - These classes are used for reading the dictionary file containing the list of valid English words. 
   - `BufferedReader` is particularly useful here because it allows the program to read the file line by line,
     which is memory-efficient for handling large files like a dictionary.

### 2. **`java.util.HashMap` and `java.util.Map`**
   - Utilization of the Hashmap data structure to store and count occurences of  character in both the user-inputted
     letters and the words from the dictionary. This allows the program to compare
     whether the available letters can form valid words.

### 3. Control Structures for Word Validation
   - A combination of loops (for and while) and conditional checks (if) is used to iterate over the dictionary words and
     compare their letter composition to the userâ€™s letters. This ensures only valid words are printed out.
